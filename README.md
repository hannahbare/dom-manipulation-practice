# DOM manipulation practice

### HTML and CSS has been generated for this practice scenario. 

## Phase 1

-Using vanilla javascript or jQuery, collect user's first and last name and append into section .user-input upon click of submit button

-Disable submit button if one of form fields is empty

-clear input fields upon click of submit button

## Phase 2

- Add a delete button to the user name on the right to remove their name

-Populate a second portion of the form upon clicking the submit button that will generate inputs for collecting the user's address, as well as a submit button inside the article class .user-address.

-Upon clicking submit in this new portion of the form, generate the user data in the .user-input section

-Add a delete button to the user address to remove their address

## Phase 3

-Upon the click of submit of user address, generate a new form in the .user-hobbies article that has an input and textarea so that a user may input a hobby and brief description of the hobby, as well as a submit button to append it to the .user-input section.

-Add a delete button to the user hobby so that it can be removed from the form.

## Phase 4! Fun!

-Upon submit of user-hobbies, create buttons in the .change-form-attributes article to toggle the background color, font-size, and border color of your newly created articles!
